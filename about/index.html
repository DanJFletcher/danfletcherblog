				<p><strong>About me.</strong><br>
				<a href="http://danfletcher.siterubix.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/WP_20141204_002.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12" src="http://imageprocessor.websimages.com/width/253/crop/0,0,253x335/danfletcherblog.webs.com/WP_20141123_002.jpg" alt="WP_20141123_002" width="400" /></a>      </p>

				<p>I am 24 years old, married, and have a 2 year old son. I love them both very much, and they mean the world to me!</p>
				</div>
				 
				 <div id="body">
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I somehow ended up climbing the social ladder in a less conventional way then most. I started working full time jobs 
				at 16, living on my own at 17, then got married and had a son at 22. And NOW I&#8217;m trying to go to 
				school. I&#8217;ve worked hard enough, and long enough trying to value hands on skills and self learned education over 
				a college diploma. But now that I&#8217;m older, more experienced and a lot less naive, I am trying to work my way into 
				a higher education while still pursuing my own studies.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My pass times have included things like dragon-boating, soccer, martial arts, and paintball. I&#8217;ve worked jobs 
				as a dishwasher, landscaper, cleaner, labourer, machinist, cashier, street busker, programmed CNC lathes, mills, drove 
				fork lift, excavators, learned how to do high voltage terminations inside of wind turbines, transformers, worked on 
				solar farms and built electrical substations from the ground up.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of this&#8230; and I still play Pokemon.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I love Pokemon.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All though it may not be my absolute favourite pass time anymore, and I don&#8217;t really have enough time to play 
				through these gems like I did as a kid, I still feel like it says a lot about who I am. I&#8217;m still a kid. Just a 
				big kid with a lot of big responsibilities! That kid also is a little bit nerdy. I&#8217;ve made money doing many many 
				things, but I long to make money as a professional game programmer. Or really any solid career  that is closely related 
				to working with and programming computers. But making games is what the 8 year old kid playing Pokemon yellow under his 
				covers with a flashlight &#8211; way past his bedtime &#8211; would probably tell me to do!</p>
