					<p><br /></p><p><span style="white-space:pre">	</span><font size="5">So, what I didn&apos;t mention in my last blog is that I&apos;m 
					recently laid off. Hopefully it's only temporarily. It's what I'm told by the higher ups at work anyway. Even when an employer says a
					lay off is not permanent, it's never for sure, so what do you do?&#160;</font></p><p><br /></p>
					
					<p><span style="white-space:pre">	</span><font size="5">You can't just hang out for weeks putting craters in the couch 'till your
					ass turns flat! Or at least I can't. So the last few days I've pretty much looked like the guy in the above picture - courtesy of
					goolge - overwhelmed by the idea of having to make decisions that could drastically change your life.&#160;</font></p><p><br /></p>
					
					<p><span style="white-space:pre">	</span><font size="5">The idea of a new job is always scary. It could mean moving to a new
					city, it always means meeting new people and you never know if you'll like the new company untill you're already stuck workig for 
					them.&#160;</font></p><p><br /></p>
					
					<p><span style="white-space:pre">	</span><font size="5">To make my life even more stressfull,
					I've decided to apply to collage at 25 years old. Well, 25 this March. Either way I believe that the only way I'm ever going to attain 
					the skills and knowledge needed in the software industry is through a formal education, even if it's a financial struggle for the next
					few years. Self teaching just has too many set backs. Programming needs to be a bigger part of my day if I'm ever to truly succeed. So
					my lay-off is just a catalyst.</font></p><p><br /></p>
					 
					 <p><span style="white-space:pre">	</span><font size="5">Now is the time for some seriously big decisions, but also huge
					 oppertunities. If I get approved for the loans I need to go to collage, I'll be learning far more far faster then could ever 
					 be possible while trying to juggle a non-related job, family, friends and my personal studies!&#160;</font></p><p><br /></p>
					 
					 <p><span style="white-space:pre">	</span><font size="5">I'll be sharing everything I learn from my schooling, as well as any
					 side projects I tackle.</font></p><p><br /></p>
					 
					 <p><span style="white-space:pre">	</span><font size="6">So enough of all this
					 personel shit for now. I said in the last blog that the focus would be on programming and sharing what I've learned. I don't know where 
					 the best place is to start, but since these blogs are not really tutorials (I might decide to do some in the future) I guess I'll just
					 start with my current projects.</font></p><p><br /></p>
					 
					 <p><span style="white-space:pre">	</span><font size="5">Recently while I've been applying to collages I've also started learning
					 how to build websites. I know it seems odd that somone who's been programming for 3+ years has never attempted to build a website...
					 but better late then never!&#160;</font></p><p><br /></p>
					 
					 <p><span style="white-space:pre">	</span><font size="5">So I've been learning html, css, and javascript. As well as playing with
					 the processing.js library for making games. My first project is to make a pong clone that runs in a web browser using processing.js.
					 You can play the current version 
					 <a href="http://danfletcherblog.ca/apps/paddles/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>. 
					 Yes it's very sketchy right now, but it's not a bad start. We have 2 paddles - 1 controlled by the player, and 1 controlled by a very
					 simple AI fucntion. There is actually a score too, so it's almost a real game. Although some versions of pong actually had no score 
					 and no true end condition, It's hard to call this a game if you can't actually lose.</font></p><p><br /></p>
					 
					 <p><span style="white-space:pre">	</span><font size="5">So that's my next goal is to set score limit to the game with a win/lose 
					 condition, instead of just playing till your eyes bleed. Which thinking of goals, I ment to post a link to the source code on the 
					 website. I'll do that now. Done.</font></p><p><br /></p>
					 
					 <p><font size="5"><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>There's a lot I have to do in a day. Funny how being off work, doesn't
					 really give you any extra time. It's really just a time when all the work that got put off and put on the "tommorow list" catches up
					 to you. With all the running around I've been doing trying to chip down the list, I actually havn't had a ton of time to sit and code.
					 But as soon as I make progress with our pong clone I'll post the update! Cheers for now.</font></p><p><br /></p>
