                <p>This was a fun one! The furniture that this company sells down in Florida is the same furniture that I used to machine and assemble while working for CRP Products Inc.</p>
                
                <p>The client accidentally removed their old site before this one was finished - so there was a huge push to get this launched as quickly as possible. After launching, the client made a sale through the site within 30 minutes of going live! Itâ€™s making a profit, but there is still a lot of testing and work to be done to get this site to an acceptable level of correctness.</p>
                
                <p>Concept and design was done by two of our designers at Redding Designs <a class="inline-link" href="#" target="_blank"><em>Corny Bartsch</em></a> and <a class="inline-link" href="#" target="_blank"><em>Vanessa Aubin</em></a>. Most of this site was programmed by me, with the help of one of our front-end devs, <a class="inline-link" href="#" target="_blank"><em>Frank Weibe</em></a>.</p>
